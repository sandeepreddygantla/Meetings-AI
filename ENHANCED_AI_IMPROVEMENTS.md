### 4. LLM Configuration Optimization (`src/config/llm_config.py`)

**Enhanced Context Limits:**
```python
CONTEXT_LIMITS = {
    'general_query': 75,           # Increased from 10-50
    'summary_query': 150,          # Increased from 100  
    'comprehensive_summary': 300,   # New: For large-scale summaries
    'detailed_analysis': 100,       # New: For detailed analytical queries
    'multi_meeting_synthesis': 200, # New: For cross-meeting analysis
}
```

**Token Optimization:**
- 90k tokens for context, 10k for response
- Intelligent token allocation based on query type
- Safety buffers and validation

**Response Quality Settings:**
- Minimum response length requirements
- Citation and example inclusion
- Context summary generation
- Adaptive detail levels

## Query Type Routing Logic

### When Enhanced Processing is Used:
1. **Summary queries** with 10+ documents
2. **No specific filters** with 10+ documents  
3. **Comprehensive analysis** requests with 5+ documents
4. **All meetings** or **all documents** queries

### Query Types Supported:
- `@project:name` - Project-specific comprehensive analysis
- `@meeting:name` - Meeting-specific detailed analysis
- `#folder` - Folder-based document analysis
- General queries without filters - All user meetings analysis
- Summary requests - Comprehensive meeting summaries

## Response Quality Improvements

### For Summary Queries:
- **Executive Overview**: High-level synthesis of all activities
- **Key Themes**: Detailed exploration of topics across meetings
- **Critical Decisions**: Comprehensive decision inventory with context
- **Action Items**: Complete compilation with status tracking
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Participant insights and contributions
- **Progress Assessment**: Achievement evaluation and outcomes
- **Strategic Implications**: Forward-looking analysis

### For General Queries:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Full address of user questions
- **Specific Details**: Quotes, examples, and concrete information
- **Natural Flow**: Conversational, logical presentation
- **Source Attribution**: Document filename citations
- **Contextual Insights**: Beyond surface-level analysis

## Architecture Integration
